A fork of [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/rafaelcamaram/react-starter-kit) with Redux **out of the box**!
You can create React apps with no build configuration. But if something doesnt work *please* [**file an issue**](https://github.com/rafaelcaramam/react-redux-starter-kit/issues/new).

## Status?

- [x] not done yet.
- [ ] ok, it's done!

## Get Started!

As this project is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.
